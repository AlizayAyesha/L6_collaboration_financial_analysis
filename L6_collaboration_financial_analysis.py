# # L6: Multi-agent Collaboration for Financial Analysis
# 
# In this lesson, you will learn ways for making agents collaborate with each other.

# The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
# ```Python
# !pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
# ```

# In[12]:


# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


# - Import libraries, APIs and LLM

# In[13]:


from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew


# **Note**: 
# - The video uses `gpt-4-turbo`, but due to certain constraints, and in order to offer this course for free to everyone, the code you'll run here will use `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
# - You can use `gpt-4-turbo` when you run the notebook _locally_ (using `gpt-4-turbo` will not work on the platform)
# - Thank you for your understanding!

# ## Creating the Crew
# - The `Process` class helps to delegate the workflow to the Agents (kind of like a Manager at work)
# - In the example below, it will run this hierarchically.
# - `manager_llm` lets you choose the "manager" LLM you want to use.

# In[24]:


from crewai import Crew, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define the crew with agents and tasks
financial_trading_crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_analyst_agent, 
            trading_strategy_agent, 
            execution_agent, 
            risk_management_agent],
    
    tasks=[data_analysis_task, 
           strategy_development_task, 
           execution_planning_task, 
           risk_assessment_task],
    
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
                           temperature=0.7),
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    verbose=True
)


# ## Running the Crew
# 
# - Set the inputs for the execution of the crew.

# In[26]:


# Example data for kicking off the process
financial_trading_inputs = {
    'stock_selection': 'AAPL',
    'initial_capital': '100000',
    'risk_tolerance': 'Medium',
    'trading_strategy_preference': 'Day Trading',
    'news_impact_consideration': True
}


# **Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.

# In[27]:


### this execution will take some time to run
result = financial_trading_crew.kickoff(inputs=financial_trading_inputs)


# - Display the final result as Markdown.

# In[28]:
